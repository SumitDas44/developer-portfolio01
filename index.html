            <h3>A Dreamer and wannabe Web Developer </h3>
            <p>I'm Sumit Das. I am majoring in Electronics and I cherish to become a full stack software engineering.
                Although i have been very lazy during the pandemic era and wasted a lot of time, I am now working very hard to achieve what I dream of. I am learning web development at the moment later i'll work on something else.</p>

            <h3>Become a web developer</h3>
            <p>I have practiced HTML and CSS before. But I am still lacking a lot. That's why I've enrolled in this programming hero course. I am learning very quickly and can make websites using html and css.</p>
